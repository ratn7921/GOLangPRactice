//uninitialized slice
// A slice is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array.
// Unlike arrays, slices do not have a fixed size and can grow or shrink as needed.
// Slices are more powerful and convenient than arrays in Go.
// Slices are built on top of arrays, and they provide a way to work with a
// portion of an array without needing to copy the data.
// A slice is a descriptor of an array segment. It consists of three components:
	var nums []int
